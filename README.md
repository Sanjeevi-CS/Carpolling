The Carpooling App is a web application that allows users to find matches for their carpool trips.

To use the Carpooling App, users must first create a profile. Once they have created a profile, they can then search for matches for their trips. When they find a match, they can contact the other user and arrange the details of the trip.

The Carpooling App also allows users to leave reviews for other users. This helps other users to make informed decisions about who to carpool with.

The Carpooling App is a great way for people to save money on transportation and reduce their carbon footprint. It is also a great way to meet new people and make friends.

## Design

The Carpooling App is a web application that is built using the Django framework. The database is PostgreSQL.

The application is divided into two main parts: the user interface and the backend. The user interface is the part of the application that users interact with. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend is the part of the application that handles the data and logic. It is built using Python.

The user interface is divided into three main sections: the home page, the search page, and the profile page. The home page is the landing page for the application. It displays a list of the latest carpool trips. The search page allows users to search for matches for their trips. The profile page allows users to view their profile, edit their profile, and view their reviews.

The backend is responsible for handling the data and logic for the application. It stores the user data, the trip data, and the review data in the database. It also handles the search functionality and the messaging
